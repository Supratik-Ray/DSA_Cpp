//instead of including each library one by one we can include all c++ libs like this
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

//for being able o take input and produce output
// #include<iostream>
//for math functions
// #include<math.h>
//for using strings
// #include<string>

//by using namespace we dont have to write std:: before the functions
using namespace std;


int main(){

  cin >> x >> y;
  cout << "the value of x and y is " << x << "and" << y;
